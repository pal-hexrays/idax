- Phase 21: 100% (example loader port continuation: completed `sep_firmware_loader.cpp` as a full-functionality idax loader port of the Binary Ninja SEP firmware plugin, covering SEP firmware detection, module-table parsing, Mach-O/raw module mapping, shared-library slide handling, header/load-command annotations, firmware type definitions/application, pointer rewrite passes, entry registration, symbol import, and example build/docs wiring)
- Phase 22: ~99% (ida-cdump parity closure in progress: wait-box UI, multiline text, typed-form C++ bindings/FormBuilder plus fixed-shape Node/Rust typed-form entrypoints, optional Qt clipboard helpers with Node/Rust wrappers and an IDA-compatible `QT_NAMESPACE=QT` build gate, IDB path, portable path helpers, Hex-Rays popup-population events, scoped Hex-Rays ownership, Local Types action-context type references, lvar/prototype metadata helpers, read-only ctree migration helpers, bulk local type declaration import, host-gated runtime harness and runner script including Hex-Rays scoped-session runtime evidence, compact parity probe example, Qt example build bridge, Node native build/runtime validation, and Rust high-level no-run validation are implemented; the updated remaining queue is interactive modal form and Qt clipboard evidence)

### Phase 18 TODO Action Items (Complete)

- [x] P18.0 Review 10 practical use cases and classify remediation by deliverable type and priority.
- [x] P18.1 Expand cookbook coverage for foundational workflows (cases 1, 4, 5) with complete setup/error-handling snippets.
- [x] P18.2 Add an end-to-end instruction-analysis recipe for mnemonic-at-address workflows (case 2), including database load, address lookup, decode failure handling, and operand inspection.
- [x] P18.3 Add a Rust plugin example + guide for cross-reference analysis (`refs_to`) with plugin lifecycle wiring (case 3).
- [x] P18.4 Add a call-graph traversal recipe/tutorial (case 6) showing transitive caller discovery with visited-set cycle protection and optional depth limits.
- [x] P18.5 Add an event-hooking tutorial for new-function discovery workflows (case 8) with callback signatures, subscription lifetime management, and teardown unsubscribe patterns.
- [x] P18.6 Add an advanced multi-binary signature-generation tutorial (case 7) covering pattern extraction, normalization/wildcards, similarity comparison, and output schema guidance.
- [x] P18.7 Add distributed-analysis architecture guidance (case 9) documenting single-writer IDB constraints, shard/merge patterns, and consistency-safe orchestration.
- [x] P18.8 Add safety/performance guidance (case 10) comparing `idax` wrapper usage vs direct raw IDA SDK usage, including trade-offs and inconsistent-SDK-state recovery playbook.
- [x] P18.9 Run a documentation information-architecture cleanup pass that clearly separates safe Rust APIs, C++ wrapper APIs, and raw FFI surfaces to reduce cross-layer confusion.
- [x] P18.10 Extend `docs/docs_completeness_checklist.md` with scenario-based acceptance criteria requiring each practical use case to map to a runnable recipe/example/tutorial.

### Phase 19 TODO Action Items (Examples-to-Bindings Continuation)

- [x] P19.1 Audit current source-example inventory vs Rust/Node binding examples and classify what is headless/standalone-portable.
- [x] P19.2 Add Node standalone tool-style ports for idalib-expressible workflows (`idalib_dump_port`, `idalib_lumina_port`, `ida2py_port`).
- [x] P19.3 Expand Rust standalone adaptation examples for processor/loader workflows (`minimal_procmod`, `advanced_procmod`, `jbc_full_loader`, `jbc_full_procmod`).
- [x] P19.4 Continue porting remaining feasible Rust adaptations for plugin/procmod/loader examples that can be represented without host plugin entrypoint macros (including `idapcode_headless_port` and `lifter_headless_port`).
- [x] P19.5 Add/refresh per-example README mapping that labels each source example as direct port, adapted standalone port, or host-constrained/not-applicable.
- [x] P19.6 Run deeper runtime validations on a known-good idalib host for newly added tool/adaptation examples and capture pass/fail matrix.

### Phase 21 TODO Action Items (Example Loader Port Continuation)

- [x] P21.1 Port `/Users/int/Downloads/sep-binja-main` SEP firmware Binary Ninja loader into a native idax example loader.
- [x] P21.2 Wire the new loader into `examples/CMakeLists.txt` and document it in `examples/README.md`.
- [x] P21.3 Validate the new example loader builds cleanly as `idax_sep_firmware_loader`.

---

### Phase 20 TODO Action Items (Real-IDA CI Hardening)

- [x] P20.1 Fix Node bindings workflow example invocation to pass only expected CLI arguments.
- [x] P20.2 Avoid Windows debug CRT link failures in Rust bindings workflow by building/running examples in `--release`.
- [x] P20.3 Harden Node Windows linkage discovery so MSVC import libs are resolved from `IDASDK` even when `IDADIR` is present.
- [x] P20.4 Fix Windows workflow shell/runtime routing so Rust uses MSVC `link.exe` (not `/usr/bin/link`) and examples resolve IDA DLLs via `PATH`.
- [~] P20.5 Re-run `Bindings CI` matrix and close residual runtime/linking regressions (current focus: validate Node macOS decompiler-wrapper pre-close disposal for `complexity_metrics` exit segfaults; verify Windows Rust runtime hardening after link fixes: minimal init argv, isolated `IDAUSR`, trace toggles (`IDAX_RUST_EXAMPLE_TRACE=1`), fixture-IDB input (avoid raw PE loader path), and build+direct-exec workflow for improved failure attribution; keep `Validation Matrix` link-safe after the loader bridge export change by providing a non-loader fallback for `idax_loader_bridge_init` while preserving real loader-module `LDSC` exports; normalize bindings-side SDK library discovery so `IDASDK=/.../ida-sdk/src` still resolves platform import libs/stubs from the checkout root or installed `IDADIR`; and account for current Windows SDK layout using `x64_win_64` / `x64_win_64_s` while restricting Rust integration execution to the stable macOS/Windows paths in `Bindings CI`).
- [x] P20.6 Close `ida::database::set_address_bitness` parity across C++ API surface checks, Node/Rust bindings, and docs/agent catalogs.
- [x] P20.7 Close `MicrocodeContext` introspection parity across Node/Rust bindings and documentation/catalog surfaces.

### Phase 22 TODO Action Items (ida-cdump Parity Closure)

- [~] P22.1 Add typed `ida::ui::ask_form` bindings and a compile-time typed `FormBuilder`. (C++ API, Node/Rust fixed-entrypoint bindings, and host-gated modal test path landed; interactive host execution remains pending.)
- [x] P22.2 Add `ida::ui::WaitBox` RAII progress/cancellation helpers.
- [x] P22.3 Expose Hex-Rays `hxe_populating_popup` as `ida::decompiler::on_populating_popup`.
- [x] P22.4 Add Local Types `TypeRef` payload support to `ida::plugin::ActionContext`.
- [~] P22.5 Add Qt clipboard, multiline `ask_text`, `database::idb_path`, and path-helper coverage. (`ask_text`, `idb_path`, `ida::path`, optional Qt clipboard helpers, Node/Rust wrappers for clipboard/text/path helpers, host-gated clipboard test path, Qt header bridge, and `QT_NAMESPACE=QT` configure guard landed; Qt UI-host execution remains pending.)
- [x] P22.6 Add Hex-Rays lvar-settings snapshot/writeback, lvar comment writeback, and function prototype apply APIs.
- [x] P22.7 Add read-only ctree migration helpers needed by `ida-cdump` analysis.
- [x] P22.8 Update docs/examples/tests and map each `ida-cdump` gap row to the new idax API. (`docs/codedump_migration_checklist.md` maps every updated gap row; compact parity probe example, local validation, Node native/runtime validation, and Rust no-run validation landed.)
- [x] P22.9 Add a scoped Hex-Rays initialization/lifetime helper for plugin-host ownership. (C++ API, Node/Rust owned-session wrappers, example lifecycle coverage, and `IDAX_RUN_HEXRAYS_SESSION=1` host runtime execution pass.)
- [x] P22.10 Add bulk local type declaration import over SDK `parse_decls` for `ida-cdump` metadata-apply migration, with Node/Rust wrappers.
